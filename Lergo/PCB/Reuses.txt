Mostly derived from su120: https://github.com/e3w2q/su120-keyboard.git
Schematic was iteratively modified, and also partially remixed with symbols from Sofle.
PCB design was massively modified, and nearly entirely rerouted so many times I am not even counting anymore...

Sofle symbols from Choc v2 RGB variant (at a time it was not merged into upstream Sofle repo): https://github.com/brianlow/SofleKeyboard.git
