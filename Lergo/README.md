# In progress...

Hey! I am still buiding and testing the design. Build and order guides will come later. Same for firmware.

For now you can get more details in the Reddit posts:
- [Original one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/qaxlw9/wip_kyfle_the_flexible_split_with_options/)
- [First batch of PCBs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/r1vawn/lergo_exkyfle_first_proto_batch/)

For your information, I did not find any critical issues so far :). But here is already a list of improvements I want to do for the next revision:
- [ ]  5 way switch silkscreen for correct holes are too small
- [ ]  LED hole is a bit small due to (poor) jlcpcb tolerances, notably for a future pick and place machine version. It's okay when hand assembling.
- [ ]  Diodes through holes have a tendancy to suck solder from the SMD pad
- [ ]  Most annular rings are a tad too small to get easy "unprecise" soldering going
- [ ]  LED bits holes are too small for tapping M1.4 screws. Try 1.3 instead of 1.2.
