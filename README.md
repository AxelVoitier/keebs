## What is the SU120?

The SU120 is an assemblable and expandable keyboard board with biscuits, screws and wire.
I use JIS Kana input method, and I designed this board to make it easier for me to make trial and error keyboard layouts.
You may make Row-Staggered, Columnar-Staggerd, Ortholinear, or other layouts keyboard.
SU is Japanese homophones: 州(sandbank) and 鬆(porous).

## Why open source?

I made it open source so that anyone interested in keyboard could try the keyboard layout more easily.
